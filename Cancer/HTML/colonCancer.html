    <p class="sec1Title"> What is Colon Cancer? </p>
    <p class="sec1text">
        Colon cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine (colon). The colon is the final part of the digestive tract.
        Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to help prevent colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they turn into cancer.
    </p>
    <p class="sec1text2"> If colon cancer develops, many treatments are available to help control it, including surgery, radiation therapy and drug treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
        Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer, which is a term that combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum.</p>

<div class="section2">
    <p class="sec2Title">Who Is More Likely To Develop Colon Cancer?  </p>
    <p class="sec2text">
        Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small,
        noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called polyps that form on the inside of the colon.
        Over time some of these polyps can become colon cancers.
    </p>

<div class="section3">
    <p class="sec3Title">What Are The Symptoms? </p>
    <p class="sec3subText1"> Signs and symptoms of colon cancer include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A persistent change in your bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation or a change in the consistency of your stool</li>
        <li>  Rectal bleeding or blood in your stool </li>
        <li>  Persistent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas or pain </li>
        <li>  A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely </li>
        <li>  Weakness or fatigue </li>
        <li>  Unexplained weight loss </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="sec3subText2"> Many people with colon cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. When symptoms appear, they'll likely vary, depending on the cancer's size and location in your large intestine.</p>

<div class="section4">
    <p class="sec4Title"> What Are Some Risk Factors?  </p>
    <p class="sec4subText1"> Factors that may increase your risk of colon cancer include: </p>

    <ul id="sec4">
        <li>Older age. Colon cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but a majority of people with colon cancer are older than 50. The rates of colon cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why. </li>
        <li> African-American race. African-Americans have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races. </li>
        <li>  A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. If you've already had colon cancer or noncancerous colon polyps, you have a greater risk of colon cancer in the future. </li>
        <li>  Inflammatory intestinal conditions. Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can increase your risk of colon cancer. </li>
        <li>  Diabetes. People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer. </li>
        <li>  Smoking. People who smoke may have an increased risk of colon cancer. </li>
        <li> Alcohol. Heavy use of alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer.</li>
    </ul>
