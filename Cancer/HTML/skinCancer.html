    <p class="sec1Title"> What is Skin Cancer? </p>
    <p class="sec1text">
        Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun.
        But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.
        There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.
    </p>
    <p class="sec1text2"> You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
        Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages.
        Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.

    <p class="sec2Title">How Does Skin Cancer Develop and Who Is Most Likely To Develop Skin Cancer?  </p>
    <p class="sec2text">
        Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women.
        But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area.</p>
    <p class="sec2text2"> Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones,
        it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. </p>

<div class="section3">
    <p class="sec3Title">Three Main Kinds + Symptoms </p>

    <p class="sec3subText1"> Basal Cell Carcinoma</p>
    <p class="sec3subText2"> Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face.</p>
    <p class="sec3subText3"> Basal cell carcinoma may appear as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A pearly or waxy bump </li>
        <li>  A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion</li>
        <li>  A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="main2" src="../Images/types-of-skin-cancer-do-you-know-how-to-spot-them-722x406.jpeg" width="650" height="400">
    <p class="sec3subText1"> Squamous Cell Carcinoma</p>
    <p class="sec3subText2"> Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face,
        ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun.</p>
    <p class="sec3subText3"> Squamous Cell Carcinoma may appear as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A firm, red nodule </li>
        <li>  A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="sec3subText1"> Melanomia</p>
    <p class="sec3subText2">Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun.</p>
    <p class="sec3subText3"> Melanoma may appear as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A large brownish spot with darker speckles</li>
        <li>  A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds</li>
        <li> A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black</li>
        <li> A painful lesion that itches or burns </li>
        <li> Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes
            lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus </li>
    </ul>
