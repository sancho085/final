    <p class="sec1Title"> What is Breast Cancer? </p>
    <p class="sec1text">
        Like all forms of cancer, breast cancer is made of unusual cells that grow out of control.
        Those cells may also travel to places in your body where they aren’t usually found. When that happens,
        the cancer is called metastatic. Breast cancer usually begins either in your glands that make milk
        (called lobular carcinoma), or the ducts that carry it to the nipple (called ductal carcinoma).
        It can grow larger in your breast and spread to nearby lymph nodes or through your bloodstream to other organs.
        The cancer may grow and invade tissue around your breast, such as your skin or chest wall.
        Different types of breast cancer grow and spread at different rates. Some take years to spread beyond
        your breast, while others grow and spread quickly. </p>

    <p class="sec2Title"> Who can get Breast Cancer?  </p>
    <p class="sec2text">
        Men can get breast cancer too, but they account for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases.
        Among women, breast cancer is the most second most common cancer diagnosed, after skin cancer,
        and the second leading cause of cancer deaths, after lung cancer. On average, 1 in 8 women will develop
        breast cancer in their lifetimes. About two-thirds of women with breast cancer are 55 or older.
        Most of the rest are between 35 and 54.</p>
    <p class="sec2Text2"> Fortunately, breast cancer is very treatable if you spot it early. Localized cancer
        (meaning it hasn’t spread outside your breast) can usually be treated before it spreads.</p>
    <p class="sec2Text3"> Once the cancer begins to spread, treatment becomes more complicated.
        It can often control the disease for years.</p>

<div class="section3">
    <p class="sec3Title"> What are the symptoms? </p>
    <ul class="sec3text">
        <li> A lump or thickened area in or near your breast or underarm that lasts through your period</li>
        <li>  A mass or lump, even if it feels as small as a pea</li>
        <li>  A change in your breast’s size, shape, or curve</li>
        <li>  Nipple discharge that can be bloody or clear</li>
        <li>  Changes in the skin of your breast or your nipple. It could be dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed.</li>
        <li>  Red skin on your breast or nipple</li>
        <li>   Changes in the shape or position of your nipple</li>
        <li>  An area that’s different from any other area on either breast</li>
        <li>  A hard, marble-sized spot under your skin</li>

         </ul>

    <ul id ="section2">
        <li> Abnormal cell growth starts in the lobules of the breast</li>
        <li> Not considered a true cancer because it is not likely to spread to surrounding tissues</li>
        <li> LCIS is an indicator that a woman may be more likely to develop invasive cancer in either breast</li>

    <ul id ="section3">
        <li> The most common type of breast cancer</li>
        <li> Starts in the ducts of the breast then grows into fatty breast tissue </li>
        <li>May also spread to other parts of the body through the lymph system and bloodstream</li>
        <li> Approximately 8 out of 10 invasive breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas</li>
